# Downstream Version Automerge

Using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), creates a downstream hierarchy for your branches which then allows for
an automated merge chain merging commits only to branches further down in the hierarchy.

This means no more redundant Pull Requests to merge code to your downstream branches.

### WHAT IS IT DOING!

Let's assume you have the following branch hierarchy:

```
master (production-branch)
|> hotfix/task-wtf-did-you-do
|> release/1.2.4
  |> bugfix/task-xyz
  |> release/1.3.0
    |> feature/task-123
    |> release/2.0.0
      |> feature/task-456
      |> develop (development-branch)
        |> project/golden-eye
```

When you merge `hotfix/task-wtf-did-you-do` into `master` whether directly or via a Pull Request, this action will then
attempt to merge the resulting `master` branch into `release/1.2.4` then if successful move on to merge `release/1.2.4`
into `release/1.3.0`, then `release/1.3.0` into `release/2.0.0`, and finally `release/2.0.0` into `develop`.

If at any point the action is unable to successfully merge the one of the branches then by default a Pull Request will
be created in order for the development team to see where the merge conflict arose and resolve the issue. Once that Pull
Request has been approved and merged that merge will effectively continue the auto-merge process where it failed before.

### WHAT IT IS NOT DOING!

This action is only focusing on the production, development, and release branches. All other branches are ignored
including branches that start with the release branch prefix, but are not Semantic Version compatible.

This means that as far as this action is concerned only these branches are in scope:

```
master (production-branch)
release/1.2.4
release/1.3.0
release/2.0.0
develop (development-branch)
```

If you happen to have a branch that is not being picked up by this Action, then please refer to the
[Node SemVer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver) library's documentation on what is a valid format as branches with
invalid version identifiers are intentionally skipped.

### WHY DO I NEED THIS?

Sometimes you're just stuck having to support development of software following a non-agile trunk based development
workflow. You might have version _1.2.3_ of your code in production on your `master` branch, version _1.3.0_
(`release/1.3.0`) being tested by your user acceptance team, and a major feature in the works that needs QA attention:
_2.0.0_ (`release/2.0.0`), and just for the heck of it, you have a dumping ground branch `develop` where your team puts
unscheduled bleeding edge completed features.

So you have a branch hierarchy that looks like this:

```
master
  ->  release/1.3.0
    ->  release/2.0.0
      -> develop
```

Now what happens when the User Acceptance team finds an issue that needs to be addressed? Normally you would have your
team approve a Pull Request from your bugfix branch into the `release/1.3.0` branch then create 2 more pull requests to
have `release/1.3.0` merged into `release/2.0.0` and lastly from `release/2.0.0` into `develop`. This has to be done in
order and requires the development team to spend a frustrating amount of time reviewing pull requests for code they've
already reviewed.

## Inputs

### `production-branch`

The primary branch matching the production environment. Default `"master"`.

### `development-branch`

The branch where active development is integrated into. Default `"develop"`.

### `release-pattern`

The Release Branch naming pattern. Default `"'release/'"`.

### `merge-message-template`

Template to generate the commit message Default: `'Auto Merged {source_branch} into {target_branch}'`

### `pr-on-failed-merge`

(yes/no) If a merge fails, create a pull request instead. Default: yes

### `pr-title-template`

Template to generate a PR title from, only used when `pr-on-failed-merge` is set to `yes` Default:
`'Failed Auto Merged {source_branch} into {target_branch}'`
